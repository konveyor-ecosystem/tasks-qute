This is an example of migrating an EAP application to Quarkus that Chris May completed.
https://github.com/christophermay07/quarkus-migrations/tree/main/tasks-qute

We are relocating the code in this repo to ease testing so we can have the original state of the EAP app in the 'main' branch and the migrated version in the 'quarkus' branch

Original source for the EAP branch is from the 7.4.x branch at:
https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/tree/7.4.x/tasks-jsf to Quarkus
